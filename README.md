- I just feel notebooks are a lucid way to communicate and visualize mathematical/algorithmic ideas. 
- I've made the Notebook more from a presentation POV. Markdowns serve as the explanation and the code blocks as support when required.

one could adapt the solution (analysis and optimization both) to be more exhaustive.
